### 2.2. Fundamental code comprehension

 Answer each of the following questions **as they relate to that code** supplied by in this repository (ignore `sense_hat.py`):

1. Examine the code for the `smiley.py` file and provide  an example of a variable of each of the following types and their corresponding values (`_` should be replaced with the appropriate values):

   | Type                    | name       | value          |
   | ----------              | ---------- | -------------- |
   | built-in primitive type | dimmed     |  True          |
   | built-in composite type | YELLOW     |  (255,255,0)   |
   | user-defined type       |class Smiley|                |

2. Fill in (`_`) the following table based on the code in `smiley.py`:

   | Object                   | Type                    |
   | ------------             | ----------------------- |
   | self.pixels              | list                    |
   | A member of self.pixels  |                         |
   | self                     | _                       |

3. Examine the code for `smiley.py`, `sad.py`, and `happy.py`. Give an example of each of the following control structures using an example from **each** of these files. Include the first line and the line range:

   | Control Flow | File       | First line  | Line range  |
   | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
   |  sequence    |  smiley.py |`self.pixels = [`| line range: 17-26
   |  selection   | sad.py     |`if wide_open:` | 26-29       |
   |  iteration   | sad.py     |`for pixel in eyes:`|25-31   |

4. Though everything in Python is an object, it is sometimes said to have four "primitive" types. Examining the three files `smiley.py`, `sad.py`, and `happy.py`, identify which of the following types are used in any of these files, and give an example of each (use an example from the code, if applicable, otherwise provide an example of your own):

   | Type                    | Used? | Example |
   | ----------------------- | ----- | --------|
   | int                     | yes     | 10 used in (eyes = [10, 13, 18 21])     |
   | float                   | yes   | delay=0.25 |
   | str                     | no    | print("Hello")|
   | bool                    | yes     |wide_open=True|

5. Examining `smiley.py`, provide an example of a class variable and an instance variable (attribute). Explain **why** one is defined as a class variable and the other as an instance variable.
 
>An example of a class variable is WHITE, it is defined as class variable because it is created in the class but outside of a function or method. An instants variable is defined in a function.
>

6. Examine `happy.py`, and identify the constructor (initializer) for the `Happy` class:
   1. What is the purpose of a constructor (in general) and this one (in particular)?

   > `def __init__(self):`
   this contructor is for initlizing the function when the class is called
   >

   2. What statement(s) does it execute (consider the `super` call), and what is the result?

   > its exectues the draw_mouth() and draw_eyes() function.
   >

### 2.3. Code style

1. What code style is used in the code? Is it likely to be the same as the code style used in the SenseHat? Give to reasons as to why/why not:

> Your answer here
>I think the code style is pep8 because the variables are whole words seperated by an underscore _.
The codding style could be the same as sense_hat because the code uses whole words for variables, self is used in both and the function names are named simarlerlly.

2. List three aspects of this convention you see applied in the code.

> The conventions I see are using whole words that are seperated with under scores, using capital letters for variables and using three quotes for comments.{needs fixing !!!}
>

3. Give two examples of organizational documentation in the code.

> 
         from smily.py 
        `"""Set the SenseHat's light intensity to low (True) or high (False)
        :param dimmed: Dim the display if True, otherwise don't dim
        """`

        from sense_hat.py 
        `"""tkinter GUI for the mock SenseHAT. Tkinter is not thread-safe, so we need to run it in a separate process."""`
>

### 2.4. Identifying and understanding classes

> Note: Ignore the `sense_hat.py` file when answering the questions below

1. List all the classes you identified in the project. Indicate which classes are base classes and which are subclasses. For subclasses, identify all direct base classes.
  
  Use the following table for your answers:

| Class Name | Super or Sub? | Direct parent(s) |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Smiley     |super          | Happy            |
|   Happy    |sub            |Smiley, Blinkable |
|Sad         |sub            |Smiley|
2. Explain the concept of abstraction, giving an example from the project (note "implementing an ABC" is **not** in itself an example of abstraction). (Max 150 words)

>Abstraction is hiding atributes that are not as important and so
>that devlopers can focus on more important things 
>an example is the class happy inheriting from the Smiley class and Blinkable class

3. What is the name of the process of deriving from base classes? What is its purpose in this project? (Max 150 words)

> inheritance, it is used in the is project by having the happy class inherit from the smiley class and blinkable class to be able to use its variables and functions.
>

### 2.5. Compare and contrast classes

Compare and contrast the classes Happy and Sad.

1. What is the key difference between the two classes?
   > Sad dosn't inherit from the blinkable class, and dosent have a blink function like happy does.
   >
2. What are the key similarities?
   > they both inherit from smiley and both have draw mouth and eyes functions
   >
3. What difference stands out the most to you and why?
   > The lack of a blink function in Sad
   >
4. How does this difference affect the functionality of these classes
   > The Sad class cant blink like the Happy function can.
   >

### 2.6. Where is the Sense(Hat) in the code?

1. Which class(es) utilize the functionality of the SenseHat?
   >- Smilely
   >- Sad through Smiley
   >- Happy using methods from Smiley
2. Which of these classes directly interact with the SenseHat functionalities?
   > Smiley talks to SenseHat directly
   >
3. Discuss the hiding of the SenseHAT in terms of encapsulation (100-200 Words)
   > There are a lot of variables within the methods of the SenseHat class that are hidden when only using the other classes, Sensehat is not referenced directly out side of the smiley class, the other classes use the smiley class to talk to sensehat 
   >

### 2.7. Sad Smileys Canâ€™t Blink (Or Can They?)

Unlike the `Happy` smiley, the current implementation of the `Sad` smiley does not possess the ability to blink. Let's first explore how blinking has been implemented in the Happy Smiley by examining the blink() method, which takes one argument that determines the duration of the blink.

**Understanding Blink Mechanism:**

1. Does the code's author believe that every `Smiley` should be able to blink? Explain.

> Yes because in main it executes the blink funcion
>

2. For those smileys that blink, does the author expect them to blink in the same way? Explain.

> Your answer here
>The author expects them to blink in the same way because because it uses a sleep function to control the delay for the blick, this is set the with a single value that can be changed when using the function. It also uses a time.sleep function set to 1 in main.py

3. Referring to the implementation of blink in the Happy and Sad Smiley classes, give a brief explanation of what polymorphism is.

>polymorphism is when classes share a common super class and the blink method gets stuff from abc and then blink in the Happy class has access to variables and methods from Smiley and Blinkable  {come back latter!}



4. How is inheritance used in the blink method, and why is it important for polymorphism?

> The blick method is used both in the class blinkable and happy, the blinkable class inhirites abc, and the happy class inhiretes blinkable, it uses...
>
1. **Implement Blink in Sad Class:**

   - Create a new method called `blink` within the Sad class. Ensure you use the same method signature as in the Happy class:

   ```python
   def blink(self, delay=0.25):
       pass  # Replace 'pass' with your implementation
   ```

2. **Code Implementation:** Implement the code that allows the Sad smiley to blink. Use the implementation from the Happy Smiley as a reference. Ensure your new method functions similarly by controlling the blink duration through the `delay` argument.

3. **Testing the Implementation:**

- Test the new blink functionality on your Raspberry Pi or within the Python classes provided. You might need to adjust the `main.py` script to incorporate Sad Smiley's new blinking capability.

Include a screenshot of the sad smiley or the modified `main.py`:

![Sad Smiley Blinking](screenshots/sad_blinking.png)

- Observe and document the Sad smiley as it blinks its eyes. Describe any adjustments or issues encountered during implementation.

  > I dont recall any issuse, other than forgting to import some things.

  ### 2.8. If It Walks Like a Duckâ€¦

  Previously, you implemented the blink functionality for the Sad smiley without utilizing the class `Blinkable`. Assuming you did not use `Blinkable` (even if you actually did), consider how the Sad smiley could blink similarly to the Happy smiley without this specific class.

  1. **Class Type Analysis:** What kind of class is `Blinkable`? Inspect its superclass for clues about its classification.

     > it is a sub class because it inherits from another class

  2. **Class Implementation:** `Blinkable` is a class intended to be implemented by other classes. What generic term describes this kind of class, which is designed for implementation by others? **Clue**: Notice the lack of any concrete implementation and the naming convention.

  > terms for the kind of class it is are Child class, subclass or descendants. ac class that is used to be inhirted by other classes is called a supper class or ancestor

  3. **OO Principle Identification:** Regarding your answer to question (2), which Object-Oriented (OO) principle does this represent? Choose from the following and justify your answer in 1-2 sentences: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation.

  > It is inheritance because it is inheriting from other classes making things from that class avlaible to the class inhirting from the parent class.

  4. **Implementation Flexibility:** Explain why you could grant the Sad Smiley a blinking feature similar to the Happy Smiley's implementation, even without directly using `Blinkable`.

  > Using the draw_eyes function and setting wide_open to false and then to true after a delay.

  5. **Concept and Language Specificity:** In relation to your response to question (4), what is this capability known as, and why is it feasible in Python and many other dynamically typed languages but not in most statically typed programming languages like C#? **Clue** This concept is hinted at in the title of this section.

  >It is called duck typing, it is not possible because in staticaly typed languges like c or c# you have to be specify what type is being used.

  ## 3. Refactoring

  ### 3.1. Does a Smiley Have to Be Yellow?

  While our current implementation predominantly features yellow smileys, emotional expressions like sickness or anger typically utilize colors like green, red, or orange. We'll explore the feasibility of integrating these colors into our smileys.

  1. **Defined Colors and Their Location:**

     1. Which colors are defined and in which class(s)?
        > WHITE, GREEN, RED and YELLOW are in the simley class
     2. What type of variables hold these colors? Are the values expected to change during the program's execution? Explain your answer.
        > They are tupls so I assume there not expected to change.
     3. Add the color blue to the appropriate class using the appropriate format and values.

  2. **Usage of Color Variables:**

     1. In which classes are the color variables used?
        > Smiley, Sad, and Happy

  3. **Simple Method to Change Colors:**
  4. What is the easiest way you can think to change the smileys to green? Easiest, not necessarily the best!
     > Change YELLOW to green by changeing its value, not the best because the name whon't match the colour.

  Here's a revised version of the "Flexible Colors â€“ Step 1" section for the smiley project, incorporating your specifications for formatting and content updates:

  ### 3.2. Flexible Colors â€“ Step 1

  Changing the color of the smileys once is straightforward, but it isn't very flexible. To facilitate various colors for smileys, it is advisable not to hardcode values in any class. This approach was identified earlier as a necessary change. Let's start by removing the built-in assumptions about color in our classes.

  1. **Add a method called `complexion` to the `Smiley` class:** Implement this instance method to return `self.YELLOW`. Using the term "complexion" instead of "color" provides a more abstract terminology that focuses on the meaning rather than implementation.

  2. **Refactor subclasses to use the `complexion` method:** Modify any subclass that directly accesses the color variable to instead utilize the new `complexion` method. This ensures that color handling is centralized and can be easily modified in the future.

  3. **Determine the applicable Object-Oriented principle:** Consider whether Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, or Encapsulation best applies to the modifications made in this step.

  4. **Verify the implementation:** Ensure that the modifications function as expected. The smileys should still display in yellow, confirming that the new method correctly replaces the direct color references.

  This step is crucial for setting up a more flexible system for color management in the smiley display logic, allowing for easy adjustments and extensions in the future.

  ### 3.3. Flexible Colors â€“ Step 2

  Having removed the hardcoded color values, we now enhance the base class to support dynamic color assignments more effectively.

  1. **Modify the `__init__()` method in the `Smiley` class:** Introduce a default argument named `complexion` and assign `YELLOW` as its default value. This allows the instantiation of smileys with customizable colors.

  2. **Introduce a new instance variable:** Create a variable called `my_complexion` and assign the `complexion` parameter to it. This step ensures that each smiley instance can maintain its own color state.

  3. **Rationale for `my_complexion`:** Using a distinct instance variable like `my_complexion` avoids potential conflicts with the method parameter names and clarifies that it is an attribute specific to the object.

  4. **Bulk rename:** We want to update our grid to use the value of complexion, but we have so many `Y`'s in the grid. Use your IDE's refactoring tool to rename all instances of the **symbol** `Y` to `X`. Where `X` is the value of the `complexion` variable. Include a screenshot evidencing you have found the correct refactor tool and the changes made.

  ![Bulk Rename](screenshots/bulk_rename.png)

  5. **Update the `complexion` method:** Adjust this method to return `self.my_complexion`, ensuring that whatever color is assigned during instantiation is what the smiley displays.

  6. **Verification:** Run the updated code to confirm that Smileys still defaults to yellow unless specified otherwise.

  ### 3.4. Flexible Colors â€“ Step 3

  With the foundational changes in place, it's now possible to implement varied smiley colors for different emotional expressions.

  1. **Adjust the `Sad` class initialization:** In the `Sad` class's initializer method, change the superclass call to include the `complexion` argument with the value `self.BLUE`, as shown:

     ```python
     super().__init__(complexion=self.BLUE)
     ```

  2. **Test color functionality for the Sad smiley:** Execute the program to verify that the Sad smiley now appears blue.

  3. **Ensure the Happy smiley remains yellow:** Confirm that changes to the Sad smiley do not affect the default color of the Happy smiley, which should still display in yellow.

  4. **Design and Implement An Angry Smiley:** Create an Angry smiley class that inherits from the `Smiley` class. Set the color of the Angry smiley to red by passing `self.RED` as the `complexion` argument in the superclass call.
